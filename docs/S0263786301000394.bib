abstract = "The management of construction is complex enough without changes (e.g. to design/specification/client requirements), yet it is a familiar characteristic of in construction projects. To effectively manage change, project managers have to undertake detailed planning; to integrate the work activities of consultants, subcontractors and suppliers. In this context, changes are unplanned disturbances that (typically) interfere with the intended progression of work. Given this 'interference', what are the consequences of such disturbances on project performance and how can/do/should project managers deal with changes effectively? This paper describes how changes (and their actions or effects otherwise known as dynamics) can impact the project management system. Using a case study and the methodology of systems dynamics, the major factors influencing a project's performance are observed. The need for understanding of how particular dynamics can hinder the performance of a project management system are highlighted."
